## Overview

### What is this project about?
This project explores the relationship between CO2 emissions and agriculture. It aims to understand the impact how the increase of co2 emissions over time has impacted crop yields and how farmers have adjusted to this.

## Project Details

### Background
Our initial goal was to see how CO2 emissions have impacted the crops over time and therefore impacted human health.

### Goals
- **Dhawani** Do countries with higher land use for agriculture have higher CO2 emissions.
- **Megan** What is the relationship between CO2 emissions and agricultural gdp.
- **Eduardo** Do countries with higher CO2 emissions use more pesticides to grow their crops?
- **Jenny** Has crop yield improved over time with pesticides? Has pesticide use decreased the amount of land needed to produce crops?

### Methodology
Detail the approach and methods used to achieve the project's goals.

In the "Methodology" section, you would typically describe the specific approaches, techniques, tools, and processes you used to accomplish the project's goals. Here are some examples of what you might include:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Data was downloaded from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Explain how you processed and cleaned the data to make it suitable for analysis. This could involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, or correcting data types.
   - **Example:** "Data was cleaned using Pandas, with missing values imputed using the median for continuous variables and mode for categorical variables."

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Discuss any transformations you applied to the data, such as normalizing, scaling, or encoding categorical variables.
   - **Example:** "Temperature values were converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius using a custom function in Pandas."

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Outline the steps you took to explore the data, including any visualizations, summary statistics, or correlation analyses.
   - **Example:** "EDA was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the distribution of temperatures across different latitudes."

5. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Describe how you created new features from the existing data that might help in analysis or modeling.
   - **Example:** "A new feature, 'Season,' was created by categorizing the 'Month' column into Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall."

6. **Data Analysis:**
   - Explain the specific analyses you conducted, whether they were statistical tests, correlation analyses, regression models, etc.
   - **Example:** "A linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between latitude and average temperature."

7. **Modeling and Prediction:**
   - If applicable, describe any machine learning models you used to make predictions or classify data.
   - **Example:** "A Random Forest model was trained to predict precipitation levels based on latitude and other weather variables."

8. **Visualization:**
   - Detail the tools and techniques you used to create visual representations of the data.
   - **Example:** "Heatmaps and line plots were generated using Seaborn to illustrate the correlation between humidity and latitude."

9. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Describe any statistical methods you employed to analyze the data, such as hypothesis testing, ANOVA, or time series analysis.
   - **Example:** "A t-test was performed to compare the mean temperatures of cities at different latitudes."

10. **Tools and Libraries:**
    - List any specific tools, libraries, or software that played a crucial role in your methodology.
    - **Example:** "The analysis was conducted in Python using Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting, and Scikit-learn for machine learning."
