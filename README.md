## Overview

### What is this project about?
Provide a brief summary of the project, including its purpose, significance, and any key questions or problems it addresses.

Example:
"This project explores the relationship between weather variables and latitude. It aims to analyze how temperature, humidity, and precipitation vary with latitude across different regions and seasons."

## Project Details

### Background
Explain the context and motivation behind the project. Include any relevant literature, prior research, or data sources that informed the project's direction.

### Goals
Outline the main objectives of the project.

### Methodology
Detail the approach and methods used to achieve the project's goals.

In the "Methodology" section, you would typically describe the specific approaches, techniques, tools, and processes you used to accomplish the project's goals. Here are some examples of what you might include:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Describe how you gathered the data for your project. This could involve web scraping, APIs, downloading datasets from public repositories, or collecting data manually.
   - **Example:** "Weather data was collected using the OpenWeatherMap API for the years 2018-2022, covering various cities across the globe."

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Explain how you processed and cleaned the data to make it suitable for analysis. This could involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, or correcting data types.
   - **Example:** "Data was cleaned using Pandas, with missing values imputed using the median for continuous variables and mode for categorical variables."

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Discuss any transformations you applied to the data, such as normalizing, scaling, or encoding categorical variables.
   - **Example:** "Temperature values were converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius using a custom function in Pandas."

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Outline the steps you took to explore the data, including any visualizations, summary statistics, or correlation analyses.
   - **Example:** "EDA was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the distribution of temperatures across different latitudes."

5. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Describe how you created new features from the existing data that might help in analysis or modeling.
   - **Example:** "A new feature, 'Season,' was created by categorizing the 'Month' column into Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall."

6. **Data Analysis:**
   - Explain the specific analyses you conducted, whether they were statistical tests, correlation analyses, regression models, etc.
   - **Example:** "A linear regression model was used to examine the relationship between latitude and average temperature."

7. **Modeling and Prediction:**
   - If applicable, describe any machine learning models you used to make predictions or classify data.
   - **Example:** "A Random Forest model was trained to predict precipitation levels based on latitude and other weather variables."

8. **Visualization:**
   - Detail the tools and techniques you used to create visual representations of the data.
   - **Example:** "Heatmaps and line plots were generated using Seaborn to illustrate the correlation between humidity and latitude."

9. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Describe any statistical methods you employed to analyze the data, such as hypothesis testing, ANOVA, or time series analysis.
   - **Example:** "A t-test was performed to compare the mean temperatures of cities at different latitudes."

10. **Tools and Libraries:**
    - List any specific tools, libraries, or software that played a crucial role in your methodology.
    - **Example:** "The analysis was conducted in Python using Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for plotting, and Scikit-learn for machine learning."
